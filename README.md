# TV Show Tracker

This is a little side project I want to work on that will be useful for myself and my partner.

I would like to practice making a full stack application. It's essentially a simple list app of what TV shows you've watched, which series you got to and a simple rating. I would like to bring in an API to add extra functionality like where to watch and a search feature but I'm focusing on the first key features as these are things I would like to practice:

- Frontend React app with lots of reuseable components
- Backend with Express and routes/ models to a database to store the information
- Using Authentication to bring up the a users own information

## Current Status

I've just set up a simple repo and currently mapping out the workflow of the app and looking at the data and component tree.
